Render is a unified cloud to build and run all your apps and websites with free TLS certificates, global CDN, private networks and auto deploys from Git.

[Render does support Rust as part of their available runtimes](https://render.com/docs/native-environments#supported-languages-and-default-versions), making the process of deploying your Graphul app a straight-forward experience.

## Deploying your project

Once you have your project repository ready you just need to log in into the Render dashboard and link your Github account. Then, you select your repo
and render will automatically detect that you're trying to build a Rust project and it will setup the build and run commands. 

After you selected your deploy configurations, your project will be built and deployed to Render.
